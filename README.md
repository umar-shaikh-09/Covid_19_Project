# COVID-19 Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data to identify patterns and predict future trends. The project leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** models to forecast the progression of the pandemic based on historical data. It provides an interactive interface where users can upload their own data and generate predictions based on the trained models.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name**: `COVID19_Data.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains COVID-19-related data for various countries and regions, including the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, over time.
- **Key Columns**:
  - `Date`: The date of the record.
  - `Region`: The region or country for the data point.
  - `Confirmed`: Number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
  - `Deaths`: Number of deaths.
  - `Recovered`: Number of recovered cases.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers to ensure accurate predictions.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Visual representation of trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
  - Heatmaps and plots showing the distribution of cases across regions.
- **Predictive Modeling with Machine Learning**:
  - A **Linear Regression** model is used to predict the future number of COVID-19 cases based on past trends.
  - **Random Forest** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models are employed for more robust predictions, considering multiple features.
  - **Time Series Forecasting** techniques, like **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), are applied to forecast future trends.
- **Interactive User Input**: Users can upload their own COVID-19 dataset to receive predictions for future cases.
- **Analysis and Insights**: Provides statistical analysis and key insights from the dataset, helping to identify which regions are most affected and potential future hotspots.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations and handling large datasets.
  - `matplotlib`: For visualizing data trends and charts.
  - `seaborn`: For creating advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
  - `scikit-learn`: For implementing machine learning models like **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **SVM**.
  - `statsmodels`: For time series forecasting using **ARIMA**.
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
